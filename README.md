# ClassPortal
<i>ClassPortal</i> is a project that simplifies the E-learning processes.

# Project Purpose
Because of the Covid-19 outbreak countries are in lockdown, educational institutes has been closed for a long time now. As a result the whole education system has become a messy. <br /> <br />
Even though a lot of institutes are trying to take classes online, they aren't  so efficient. Even students and teachers needs to have accounts in multiple flatforms to stay in sync. For example, maybe teacher will take class in an online video conference app. But to have all students joined here, teachers have  to give link in an another platform. Then students may have any query for teacher, again for this reason they need to have accounts in a chatting application. So number of acounts goes up and up.
So in ClassPortal we tried to solve this part. We developed a web application where teacher can create Room and can post class links, students can comment/question, teacher can create different sections according to types of information he/she can share.
